# An open-source storage format that brings ACID transactions to Apache Sparkâ„¢ and big data workloads.

### Open format: Stored as Parquet format in blob storage.
### ACID Transactions: Ensures data integrity and read consistency with complex, concurrent data pipelines.
### Schema Enforcement and Evolution: Ensures data cleanliness by blocking writes with unexpected.
### Audit History: History of all the operations that happened in the table.
### Time Travel: Query previous versions of the table by time or version number.
### Deletes and upserts: Supports deleting and upserting into tables with programmatic APIs.
### Scalable Metadata management: Able to handle millions of files are scaling the metadata operations with Spark.
### Unified Batch and Streaming Source and Sink: A table in Delta Lake is both a batch table, as well as a streaming source and sink. Streaming data ingest, batch historic backfill, and interactive queries all just work out of the box.
